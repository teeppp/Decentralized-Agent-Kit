  # Filesystem Management
  
  You have access to the local filesystem. Use these tools to navigate, read, and modify files.
  
  ## Workflow
  1. **Explore**: Use `list_files` to see what's in a directory.
  2. **Search**: Use `search_files` to find specific files by pattern (e.g., `*.py`).
  3. **Read**: Use `read_file` to examine file content.
  4. **Edit**: Use `write_file` to create or overwrite files.
  
  ## Safety Guidelines
  - **Check Existence**: Before reading or writing, verify the path exists or is correct.
  - **Read First**: Before overwriting a file with `write_file`, read it to ensure you don't lose important data.
  - **Relative Paths**: Always use paths relative to the project root.
