"""Real-LLM smoke tests (local Ollama by default).

These verify actual model behavior (prompt quality, tool selection) that the
deterministic fake-LLM suite cannot. A small local model is non-deterministic,
so assertions are deliberately tolerant: they check that the pipeline produced
a sane outcome, not exact wording.

Enable with DAK_SMOKE_REAL_LLM=1 after starting the stack with the
docker-compose.local-llm.yml overlay (see scripts/smoke_local_llm.sh).
